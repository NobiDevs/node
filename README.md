# Node
100% Secure. No servers, no limits.

Node is a serverless, peer-to-peer communication tool designed for local networks. It lets users instantly discover and connect with others on the same Wi-Fi or LAN — enabling real-time messaging and file sharing without needing the internet, accounts, or any setup straight from your browser.

Behind the scenes, Node uses WebRTC for encrypted, direct connections between devices and a self-elected "host" node to handle signaling. Once connected, all communication is fully peer-to-peer. Whether you're collaborating offline, transferring files across devices, or just chatting within a network, Node builds a secure, temporary mesh network — and you're a part of it.
